# Project Milestones

- [x] 1. Outline design, structure, requirements and initial set of milestones.

- [ ] 3. Organize vector store (Chroma). Connect embeddings and implement retrieval.
- [ ] 4. Add LLM generation to form the RAG pipeline.
- [ ] 5. Implement web search (SerpAPI/parsing) and cache results in the vector store.
- [ ] 6. Create a reminder manager using APScheduler.
- [ ] 7. Implement explicit memory with `/remember`, `/list_memories`, `/edit_memory`, and `/delete_memory` commands.
